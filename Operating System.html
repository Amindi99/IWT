 <p>As a matter of fact, operating systems are not designed to utmost perfection since at times they suffer from a number of problems. Such problems can be very 
 inconveniencing if one are not familiar with the troubleshooting tools. Hence one should be aware of all these techniques which can resolve the problem so one can 
 continue working without any problems. Below are some of the common operating problems and their troubleshooting tools.</p>
 
 <h3>What is an operating System?</h3>
 <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.</p>

 <h1>1.BSOD</h1>
 
 <img class="pic" src="images/OS1.jpg">
 
 <p>The blue screen of death is a Windows stop error that clearly points onto hardware malfunction or spoilt device drivers. One may decide to start in safe mode 
 or carry out some System Restore.</p>
 
 <h1>2.Failure to boot</h1>
 
 <img class="pic" src="images/OS2.jpg">
 
 <p>Failure of one's computer to boot can be as a result of a corrupt operating system or some possible changes in one's system's boot order. One can go to the BIOS
 setup and try to look at the boot sequence. If that does not work, then one should consider reinstalling the Windows operating system since the problem could be far
 much serious.</p>

 <h1>3.Improper shutdown</h1>
 
 <img class="pic" src="images/OS3.jpg">
 
 <p>At times, one's computer may shutdown improperly due to instances of power loss or crushing. In case of such an incidence, restarting the computer might not take 
  one directly to Windows and therefore one should run Windows Error Recovery which automatically checks the file system and drives for any problems. With that, all 
  system files are placed in their right positions and Windows now starts without any problems.</p>
 
 <h1>4.Spontaneous shutdown/restart</h1>
 
  <img class="pic" src="images/OS4.jpg">
 
<p>This is a problem that mostly occurs in instances where one's computer keeps looping over the start-up process where it appears to be starting and then restarts.
 In such a case, the first step should be to try and establish the occurrence point of the problem either in the course of the BIOS check where the Power on Self-test
 is undergoing among some other possible reasons. Once that is established, then one can easily decide if the problem is hardware related or related to the Windows 
 configuration.</p>

 
 <h1>5.RAID not detected during installation</h1>
 
   <img class="pic" src="images/OS5.jpg">
 
<p>This is an error message that tends to appear when one are installing an operating system and some of the files required are not found. In such a case, one might open 
the registry in safe mode to check for the files or restart the installation process with a new installation media..</p>
 
 <h1>6.Device fails to start</h1>
 
 <img class="pic" src="images/OS9.jpg">
 
<p>Failure of one's device can be very frustrating. In most cases, it normally results from a computer crush or some other hardware related problems. In such a case, try to 
carry out hardware diagnostics so as to try and establish the problem. One can also decide to boot the computer from a Windows installation media to try and get one's computer 
to restart.</p>
 
 <h1>7.Missing dll message</h1>
 
 <img class="pic" src="images/OS6.png">
 
<p>The missing dll message mainly appears when the dynamic link libraries are missing. This could be as a result of using many third party applications leading to much redundancy
 in all the applications. Dlls have many different versions and therefore a lack of update can lead to such a pop-up message. Overwriting older versions with new versions can be very
 dangerous since there can be some possible malfunction.</p>
 
<h1>8.Services fail to start</h1>

 <img class="pic" src="images/OS7.jpg">

<p>At times, starting one's system might become a problem due to the fact that one can receive a pop-up message informing one that there is a failure in the starting of one or more services.
 Since it is very difficult to establish the problem, some information should be collected. One can manually start services at the Windows services so as to see if any of them will fail.</p>

<p>In addition to manually starting the services, try to look at processes the services depend on since the process may have to start so that the service can also begin running. One might also 
need to install a special type of software that will manage the service, rebuilt it and reconfigure it so that every inch of that service starts properly.</p> 

<h1>9.Compatibility error</h1>

<img class="pic" src="images/OS8.png">

<p>The Windows operating system compatibility error mainly appears when some of the old application versions are not working properly after a windows upgrade. In such cases, Windows has an in-built 
capability that allows one to change the compatibility of the applications. One can also choose to run the program in its compatibility mode so as to choose the most appropriate operating system for
 the application. In some cases, the old and out-dated applications can also run in a new version of Windows as long as they are in their compatibility mode.</p>

 <h1>10.Slow system performance</h1>
 
   <img class="pic" src="images/OS10.jpg">
 
 <p>A slow system performance is a problem that can be fixed by making sure that onehas installed the latest versions of all items running in one's computer system such as the operating system, 
 drivers and applications. All security patches should be up to date and all Windows updates should functional. Slow system performance could be as a result of some in-built configurations such as 
 running the CPU slowly when on battery and not on power. Malicious software could also be a cause of slow system performance hence a computer scan can be very essential.</p>
