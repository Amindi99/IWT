        <p class="discription to-center">
                TCS originally started in early 2014. Originally based in Sri Lanka, 
                It grew to a team of over 50 Linux Support Engineers before our founder, 
                Prashan De Seram established TCS to serve an emerging market. There was an
                 underserved customer support needed for fast-growing tech startups. After 
                 much research, Prashan established an office in the Sri Lanka and grew the 
                 company to a team of over 100 members before appointing fellow entrepreneur,
                  Mihiran Rupasinghe to be CEO. The duo form a unique partnership, as Prashanâ€™s
                   passion exists with technology and processes while Mihiran loves working with
                    people. The company now employs 250+ people in its Sri Lankan office with 
                    ambitious expansion plans. 
                Today, TCS is a company that services some of the biggest names in tech .
